# TripsPH: Transportation RFID Integrated System using PHP

# What is TripsPH?

The TripsPH (Transportation RFID Integrated System using PHP) is our
Thesis entitled the "Bus Ticketing System with RFID and E-payment Integration
for bus fare collection" introduces a multifaceted approach to optimize
bus ticketing systems. Its core technology is powered by the ESP-8266
microcontroller that utilizes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) for
enhanced data retrieval, fare administration, and passenger convenience.
Specialized Arduino code ensures accurate recording of card entry and
exit, providing precise data retrieval and passenger tracking during bus
journeys. Haversine formula was implemented specifically to manage fare
collection and calculate distances travelled. The system also features
a thermal printer to generate journey tickets and receipts, displaying
fare amount, journey details, and other relevant information such as
distance travel and the place of dispatch and arrival. Real-time
communication is facilitated through a status indicator, utilizing a
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) for success
and failed tapping, resulting in efficient communication and transit
operations. The study also integrates a comprehensive Administrative
System, enabling various user roles to manage fare matrix, rules, profiles,
and trip records, thereby ensuring efficient management and control of
associated data. With automation processes handling passenger origin
and destination details, verifying accuracy, and calculating distances
travelled, fare calculation and collection are further simplified.
The Stripe integration as a digital payment method allows cashless
transactions for RFID cards which provides real-time updates on payment
status but the reloading system was not limited to this type of payment;
it was also available in Gcash and Paymaya. This system effectively
collects, stores, and manages reload transaction records, ensuring
transparency and accountability throughout its operation.

:house: TripsPH Admin Dashboard

- if fare > total_balance failed
- if total_balance < 200 failed no computation
- if failed yung reloading sa reload table no computation
- if from reload, "reloading" yung type
- if from passenger table without fare value "Departed" yung type
- if fromif from passenger table with fare value "Arrived" yung type
- ticket_no. resets every-day composed of number and row and date ex. 1-270723 (1 is row no. 27 day, 07 month, 23 )

:mouse: TripsPH Fare Box

1. Tap in and Tap out of RFID TripsPH Cards to record the cards details including the coordinates and calculate the Km. Travelled for the fare
2. Print Receipt from the point of Entry and Exit
3. Show the TripsPH Card Balance, Status and Location to the LCD

The RFID reader is a device that can read and write data from RFID cards, which are used by passengers to pay for their bus fares. The RFID reader is connected to the ESP-8266 microcontroller, which is the core of the system. The ESP-8266 microcontroller is a low-cost Wi-Fi chip that can communicate with the internet and other devices. It runs the Arduino code that implements the Haversine formula to calculate the distance travelled by the passengers and the fare amount. The ESP-8266 microcontroller also sends the data to the thermal printer, which prints out the tickets and receipts for the passengers. The thermal printer shows the fare amount, journey details, and other relevant information such as distance travel and the place of dispatch and arrival.The ESP-8266 microcontroller also controls the status indicator, which consists of an LCD display and an LED. The status indicator shows the success or failure of tapping the RFID card, as well as the balance and other messages. The LCD display is a screen that can show text and graphics, while the LED is a light that can change color depending on the status.The hardware components are powered by a battery or an external power source, depending on the availability and preference of the bus operator. The hardware components are also enclosed in a durable casing to protect them from damage and theft.
